Rick and Morty, the popular animated TV show created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, often delves into science fiction, multiverse theory, and existential themes. While there are no official conspiracy theories associated with the show, fans have come up with some interesting ideas and interpretations. Here are a few conspiracy-like topics that have been discussed within the Rick and Morty fan community:

1. Evil Morty's True Identity: Evil Morty, a recurring character in the show, has sparked speculation about his origins and motives. Some fans theorize that he is actually the original Morty from C-137, the dimension where the main characters reside. They believe that he became disillusioned with Rick and seeks revenge or to overthrow him.

2. The Council of Ricks: In the show, there is a group called the Council of Ricks, which consists of various versions of Rick from different dimensions. Some fans have proposed that the Council of Ricks is secretly manipulating events in the multiverse to maintain control and suppress the power of other Ricks.

3. Rick's True Motives: Rick, the show's main character, is known for his eccentric behavior and intelligence. Some fans have speculated that there might be a deeper reason behind his reckless and nihilistic actions. They suggest that Rick is intentionally pushing Morty to grow and evolve, possibly as part of a grand plan or experiment.

4. The True Nature of the Citadel of Ricks: The Citadel of Ricks is a central hub for Ricks and Mortys from different dimensions. Fans have discussed the possibility that the Citadel is not just a neutral gathering place but may have hidden agendas, such as controlling and monitoring Ricks and Mortys or serving as a front for more sinister activities.

5. Connection to other TV Shows: Rick and Morty often references and parodies other TV shows, movies, and pop culture. Some fans have explored the idea that there could be deeper connections or hidden meanings behind these references, suggesting that Rick and Morty might exist within a larger shared multiverse of fictional universes.

It's important to note that these theories and interpretations are purely speculative and created by fans. They are not endorsed or confirmed by the creators of Rick and Morty. The show often embraces absurdity and unpredictability, making it difficult to pinpoint definitive answers to these topics.
